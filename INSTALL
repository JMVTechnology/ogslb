Installing ogslb

Requirements:
python
redis
powerdns

Install:
Currently, ogslb has some hard coded paths that require it to live under /opt/ogslb.  

Redis needs to be running on 'localhost'.

Powerdns needs to be configured to use the ogslb backend.  Typically, ogslb will be configured to handle requests first in powerdns and if it doesn't have any matching data, the request will fall through to the next available backend such as bind style zone files.  Additionally, you will typically want to disable caching of dns records in powerdns to make sure you have the latest version of data from ogslb.

Powerdns config (often /etc/pdns/pdns.conf):

launch=pipe,bind			# launch the backends in order of the ogslb pipe, then the bind zone files
pipe-command=/opt/ogslb/bin/backend.py	# where the ogslb backend lives
negquery-cache-ttl=0			# disable negative caching
query-cache-ttl=0 			# disable query caching

Running:
Once powerdns is configured, it will need to be restarted to pick up the new ogslb backend.

Now, you will need to configure oglsb to tell it what to monitor.  Take a look at the POLLERS text file to understand how to configure etc/pollers.xml.

Once etc/pollers.xml has been configured, simply start bin/ogslbd.

Testing:
You can use bin/view.py to get a basic idea of what has been collected by ogslbd and stored in redis.
